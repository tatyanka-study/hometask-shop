# Delivery App

Web application where users can order food delivery

## Download & Get started

This app can be downloaded or cloned.

It`s at the link (https://github.com/tatyanka-study/hometask-shop.git).

**To download follow the link** 

1. Download ZIP file from the link:
There will be a green button with the inscription (< > Code). When you click it? you`ll see drop-down list inside which is the last item (Download ZIP). Click it and save the file. 

2. Open downloaded folder with files in code editor:
Unzip the downloaded file and open it in a code editor. For example, in Visual Studio Code. Since the application is written using the React library it must be installed in your code editor. If not, install it. 

3. You must install dependencies from `package.json`. To do this, open a terminal in a code editor and write in it:
```
 npm install
```
4. To launch a working application in a browser, write the command in the terminal:
```
 npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

5. To stop the application, press `CTRL+C`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
